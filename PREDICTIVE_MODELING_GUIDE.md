## üéØ What Was Accomplished

### ‚úÖ **Three Predictive Models Built:**

1. **Churn Prediction Model** (Classification)
   - Predicts which customers will churn (stop buying)
   - Multiple algorithms tested: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
   - Best model: Gradient Boosting (93.4% accuracy, 0.979 AUC-ROC)

2. **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction** (Regression)
   - Predicts future customer value
   - Algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
   - Best model: Gradient Boosting (R¬≤ = 0.896)

3. **Purchase Timing Analysis** (Rule-Based)
   - Predicts when customers are due to purchase
   - Calculates probability of purchase in next 30 days
   - Identifies overdue customers

## üéì MODEL INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### üìä **How to Use Churn Predictions:**

**Churn Probability Ranges:**
- 0.0 - 0.3 = Low Risk (Green light)
- 0.3 - 0.6 = Medium Risk (Monitor)
- 0.6 - 0.8 = High Risk (Action needed)
- 0.8 - 1.0 = Critical Risk (URGENT)

**Example:** Customer with 0.85 churn probability = 85% chance they will not purchase in next 90 days

### üí∞ **How to Use CLV Predictions:**

**Predicted CLV represents:** Expected total future value from that customer

**Use cases:**
- **Budget allocation:** Spend more acquiring similar profiles
- **Resource prioritization:** Give more attention to high CLV
- **Discount limits:** High CLV customers = can afford bigger discounts
- **Segment targeting:** Focus campaigns on high predicted CLV segments

**Example:** Customer with ‚Ç¶5M predicted CLV = Worth investing ‚Ç¶500K in retention (10% CAC ratio)

### ‚è∞ **How to Use Purchase Timing:**

**Optimal Contact Times:**
- **Due Soon:** Contact 7-14 days before expected purchase
- **Overdue:** Immediate reminder campaigns
- **Severely Overdue:** Aggressive win-back with incentives
