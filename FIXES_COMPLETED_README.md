## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "FileNotFoundError" when running dashboard
**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're in the correct directory:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\akogo\Desktop\Folders\A_city
   ```
2. Verify CSV files exist:
   ```bash
   dir *.csv
   ```
3. Ensure required files are present:
   - rfm_with_predictions.csv ✅
   - transactions_clean.csv ✅

### Problem: "Module not found" errors
**Solution:**
Install missing packages:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy plotly
```

### Problem: Dashboard loads but shows "No data" error
**Solution:**
1. Check that CSV files are in the SAME directory as afrimash_dashboard.py
2. Run main.ipynb to generate missing CSV files
3. Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Problem: Charts not displaying
**Solution:**
1. Clear Streamlit cache: In dashboard, click menu → "Clear cache"
2. Refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
3. Check browser console for errors (F12)
