SECTION 7: DEMONSTRATION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

BEFORE THE PRESENTATION
------------------------
‚ñ° Ensure dashboard runs without errors (streamlit run dashboard.py)
‚ñ° Pre-load all data files to avoid delays
‚ñ° Test all interactive features
‚ñ° Prepare 2-3 example customer IDs for live demos
‚ñ° Have backup slides in case of technical issues
‚ñ° Clear browser cache for smooth visualizations
‚ñ° Test internet connection if using AI features
‚ñ° Prepare handouts with key metrics
‚ñ° Have architecture diagram printed


DURING LIVE DEMO
----------------
‚ñ° Start with Executive Dashboard - make immediate impact
‚ñ° Navigate smoothly between pages
‚ñ° Use real customer data for authenticity
‚ñ° Point out specific insights, not just features
‚ñ° Relate everything back to business value (‚Ç¶ revenue)
‚ñ° Let them interrupt with questions
‚ñ° Be ready to go deeper on any feature
‚ñ° Show both good and bad news (credibility)
‚ñ° Highlight actionable recommendations
‚ñ° End with implementation timeline


DEMO SCRIPT EXAMPLES
---------------------
Example 1 - Churn Prediction:
"Let me show you a real at-risk customer. This is Customer CUS001234,
currently spending ‚Ç¶2.3M annually - one of your top 100 customers.
Our model gives them a 78% churn probability. See this red alert?
It's recommending immediate personal contact and a 15% discount.
If we lose this customer, that's ‚Ç¶2.3M gone. But if we intervene
now, we have a 70% chance of retention."

Example 2 - Recommendations:
"For this Champion customer who frequently buys livestock feed,
our recommendation engine suggests these 5 products with 85%
confidence. Notice they're not random - they're based on similar
customers who made these purchases. The potential order value?
‚Ç¶450,000. That's personalization at scale."

Example 3 - Segmentation:
"Look at this Champions segment - 234 customers generating
‚Ç¶847M in revenue. That's 7.5% of customers driving 26% of revenue.
Now compare to 'At Risk' - 543 customers with ‚Ç¶654M at stake.
Different segments, different strategies, all data-driven."


HANDLING OBJECTIONS
-------------------
Objection: "This looks complex for our sales team"
Response: "That's why we built the Models in Action page - it's
point-and-click simple. Just enter customer data and get instant
recommendations. We'll provide 30-minute training sessions."

Objection: "What if the predictions are wrong?"
Response: "Great question. Our models are 93% accurate, but we also
provide confidence scores. Low confidence predictions are flagged.
Plus, these are decision support tools - humans make final calls."

Objection: "How much will this cost to maintain?"
Response: "Cloud option is $500-1,000/month all-inclusive. But
consider the ROI: saving just 10 at-risk customers pays for a
year of operation. We project 15-20x ROI."

Objection: "How long until we see results?"
Response: "Week 1 results from emergency interventions. Month 1
measurable impact on churn. Full ROI visible in 6-12 months.
We'll track metrics monthly and adjust strategy."
